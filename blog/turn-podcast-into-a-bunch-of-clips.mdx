Having a podcast is a great way to engage with an audience, create brand awareness, drive conversions, and grow your business. But there are lots of other ways to use your podcasts beyond just streaming them online. One of the most popular methods is to turn them into clips that can be used on different platforms, such as social media and streaming sites. Doing so offers lots of opportunities to attract new fans and drive more engagement.

In this guide, we’ll discuss how to easily turn a podcast into a bunch of clips that can be shared on different platforms.

## How to Cut Podcast into Clips

The first step is to determine which parts of the podcast you want to clip. This can be done in a number of ways: you can manually make cuts manually in a DAW or audio editor, or make use of an automated transcription service. We’ll cover both methods below.

### Manual Cutting

If you’re looking to quickly make clips of your podcast, the easiest way is to use a DAW to manually cut sections of the podcast into individual clips. This method offers more control and allows you to easily create different clip lengths.

First, open the podcast in the DAW and use the zoom tools to find the parts you want to clip. Then, select the entire section and copy it to the clipboard. You can then paste the clip onto a new audio track, and use the tools to set the start and end points for the clip. Repeat this process for each clip you want to create.

### Automated Transcription Services

If you don’t want to manually make clips of your podcast, an automated transcription service can do it for you. These services use AI to transcribe an audio into text, which can then be used to automatically create clips.

To use this method, simply upload the podcast to the transcription service, wait for it to be transcribed, and then easily cut the resulting text into individual clips. You can then customize the clips and upload them to the desired streaming service.

## Tips for Making Clips from Podcasts

Once you’ve cut the podcast into clips, there are a few things you can do to further optimize them for different platforms.

### Use Engaging Thumbnails

The thumbnail of the clip is the first thing people will see when they search for it online, so selecting an engaging one is key to driving clicks. Pick a thumbnail that will stand out and entice viewers, such as a relevant image or a short GIF.

### Keep Clips Short and Engaging

As you’re clipping your podcast, it’s important to remember that people have short attention spans. Keep clips short – under 1 minute – and engaging. And make sure each clip has a message or takeaway, so that people will be compelled to watch your podcast until the end.

### Focus On Your Target Audience

When you’re selecting sections to be clipped, focus on what will be of most interest to your target audience. Content that will pique their curiosity, make them laugh, or simply appeal to their interests will be more likely to drive clicks and engagement.

### Use SEO Optimized Titles and Descriptions

To ensure that people are able to discover the clips, make sure to include your target keyword in the titles and descriptions. Also, include any relevant meta keywords and hashtags so that your clips will appear in relevant search results.

## Conclusion

Clipping a podcast into bite-sized chunks is a great way to boost engagement, grow your audience, and drive conversions. By making use of automated transcription services and a DAW, you can quickly and easily turn a podcast into a series of clips that can be used on different platforms. And by following the tips in this guide, you’ll be sure to create clips that will capture viewers’ attention and drive engagement.
