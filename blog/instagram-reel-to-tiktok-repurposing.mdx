Creating content can be tedious and overwhelming, but repurposing already existing content can be a great way to maximize usage with minimal effort. Instagram Reels have become increasingly popular among brands due to their ability to entertain, engage and inform viewers. But, have you ever considered repurposing these reels into another platform, such as tiktok? Today we will be discussing the advantages of repurposing Instagram Reels to TikTok, as well as tactics users can use to make the move as seamlessly as possible. 

## Benefits of Repurposing

The biggest advantage in repurposing Instagram Reels to TikTok is the fact that you can essentially reach a whole new audience. Not everyone uses both platforms, so creating content that is to be seen and appreciated by a broader audience has a great potential to increase impressions, followership and overall engagement. 

In addition to a widened audience, content can be used multiple times. Since each app has a shorter shelf life, it allows for new content to keep being re-purposed when it is needed. It also lowers the time and energy required to craft new content. Similarly, taking one piece of content and forming it between two or more platforms drives more attention to content. Keeping the same style and format on both platforms allows users to recognize the brand’s style of content, which can help create more brand recognition.

## Strategies for Repurposing

Now that we’ve gone over the advantages of repurposing, let’s discuss a few tips that can make the transition easier.

### Storytelling

Creating a multi-platform narrative story is one way to repurpose content between the two. As each platform has its own unique aspect, they can both offer something different and both be part of a larger narrative. This method allows for the story to keep developing, as you are always releasing new content and progressing the narrative.  

### Music

Music is a very important aspect of any reel or tiktok video. This is something to keep in mind when repurposing content. Whether this means slightly adjusting the background music or adding music to the post that will fit the platform’s style and culture, making sure that the content feels like it belongs to the platform is a key part of making any repurposed content successful. 

### Aesthetics

Creating content that perfectly fits the platform you are posting it to is key to having effective content. This can include adjusting text, colors, visuals, thumbnails and the language in the post. Every little detail can be adjusted to better fit the platform. For example, making sure the beginning and ending of each post has a logical flow, record the same clip with multiple angles to repurpose it in different ways, or adjusting text for length. 

## Final Thoughts 

Repurposing content is not only beneficial in terms of time and energy, but also for widening reach and creating a style or “brand” of content. While repurposing content does require ample amounts of creativity, planning and strategy, when executed properly it can be one of the most effective and efficient ways to create content. Keeping the tips provided in mind, we hope that your content repurposing process is made seamless. 

Good luck!
