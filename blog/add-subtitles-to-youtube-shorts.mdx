Youtube Shorts is an exciting new feature offered by Youtube that enables anyone to create and upload short, highly engaging videos to share with their followers. It is a great platform for brand-building, connecting with potential customers, and marketing one's product and services. But one of the most important aspects of creating quality content for Youtube Shorts is adding subtitles for viewers who may have trouble understanding the content due to language barriers. 

In this article, we will look at how you can add subtitles to your Youtube Shorts videos.

## Benefits of Subtitling Youtube Shorts

Adding subtitles to your Youtube Shorts videos is an essential way to ensure that maximum viewers have access to your content, regardless of the language they speak. Subtitles allow your videos to be more accessible to a wider range of viewers and can enhance their viewing experience. 

Studies have shown that subtitles can boost views and engagement by up to 20%, helping your content reach a larger audience and boosting brand visibility. Furthermore, adding subtitles helps make your videos more widely accessible to viewers with disabilities, so it is an essential part of creating inclusive content. 

## What You Need to Add Subtitles to Your Youtube Shorts

The two most popular options are SRT and VTT, and you can use either of these formats to add subtitles to your videos. 

Your file should also be saved in UTF-8 encoding, which is the only format that is supported by Youtube. You can easily use a text editor like Notepad or Wordpad to convert the file into UTF-8 encoding and save it. 

## How to Add Subtitles to Your Youtube Shorts

Once you have the subtitle file ready, you can easily add them to your Youtube Shorts videos. Here is a simple step-by-step guide to help you get started:
