Have you ever wanted to add captions to your LinkedIn video but just weren't sure how to do it? We share great content on LinkedIn all the time, and adding captions to our videos is one of the best ways to give them an extra boost. In this article, we'll show you how to add captions to your LinkedIn videos. 

## What are the Benefits of Adding Captions to a LinkedIn Video?

Adding captions to your LinkedIn videos can help your video get more views, shares, and engagement. By adding captions to your video, you make your video accessible to people who are viewing it with the sound turned off. This can help to increase your reach and engagement with people who are watching your videos while on the go or in a loud environment. 

Captions also help to improve the watch time of your video, as people are more likely to watch something for longer if they can understand it. Additionally, captions help with SEO, as they add extra keywords to the page and make it more searchable.
