Automatically posting to Instagram from Facebook can seem like a daunting task at first, but if you follow these easy steps, you'll be up and running in no time! With these steps, you'll be able to create engaging posts on Instagram that show off your brand to its fullest potential.

## Step 1: Connect Your Pages
First, you'll need to connect your Facebook page and your Instagram account. This can be done in only a few steps. 

First, go to the Facebook page and select ‘Settings’. This will open up a page with a number of different sections. Find the section for ‘Page’ and select ‘LinkedIn and Instagram’. Here, you'll be asked to enter your Instagram username. Once this is done, you'll need to authorise the connection.

## Step 2: Set Up Posting Preferences

Once the accounts are connected, you'll need to decide what type of posts you want to show up on Instagram. To do this, go to the ‘Page’ section and select ‘Posting Preferences’. Here, you'll be presented with a number of different options. Choose the type of posts you want to be posted on Instagram, such as photos, videos, and links. You can also decide whether the posts should be sent to all followers, or only those that follow both the Facebook page and the Instagram account.

## Step 3: Create the Post

Now it's time to create the post that will be automatically posted on Instagram. You'll need to open up the Facebook page and create a new post. Here, you'll be able to add images, videos, or links, along with some text. Once you're happy with the content, select ‘Post’.

## Step 4: Make Sure the Post is Posted to Instagram

After you've posted the content, you'll need to confirm that it's been sent to Instagram. To do this, go to your Instagram feed and make sure that the post is there. If it isn't, go back to the Facebook page and make sure the posting preferences are correct. If they are, then it may be best to contact Instagram support for more help.

## Step 5: Manage Your Posts

Finally, to make sure that your posts are running smoothly, you'll want to monitor them regularly. This can be done in a few different ways. You can create a calendar that outlines the posting schedule, or use a platform like Hootsuite to manage the posts. You can also utilize social media analytics to better understand how your posts are performing.

With these easy steps, you'll be able to set up and manage a Facebook to Instagram auto post system with ease. By understanding how to automatically post to Instagram from Facebook, you'll be able to create engaging posts that show off your brand in the best way possible.
