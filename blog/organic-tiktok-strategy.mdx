From its humble beginnings, the TikTok app has grown to become the sixth most popular social media platform worldwide. In 2020, it was among the most downloaded apps of the year according to Statista. This is why savvy digital marketers are paying close attention to the exploding platform.

But to effectively use TikTok as a marketing tool, you must have an organic strategy in place. Having a good relationship with the TikTok algorithm, a following base, and an effective content plan are all components of a successful organic marketing strategy.

## Understand the TikTok Algorithm 

The TikTok algorithm uses a mix of signals including engagement, likes, shares, and other user behavior to determine which videos are more interesting to viewers. For example, if you produce content that encourages people to engage, your video is likely to appear on the For You tab.

## Step Up Your Content Game

It's important to have an effective content strategy in place to make sure your brand's content stands out. You should be creative, include visuals, and use humor to grab the attention of viewers.

You should also ensure your content is of high quality, as amateur videos can have an adverse effect on your account. Additionally, it should be tailored to the platform format: since TikTok encourages short-format video content, your video should be focused and concise.

## Leverage TikTok Ads

Organic reach on TikTok isn’t particularly strong yet, which is where leveraging TikTok ads can have a tremendous impact on your business’ visibility.

Creating a TikTok ad campaign is relatively easy, and you can target your desired audience. You can reach potential customers from different demographics, geographic locations, and interests.

## Form Strategic Partnerships

By partnering with influencers, you’re able to promote your brand’s message without having to invest a lot of time and effort. Most influencers have developed a level of trust with their audiences, and therefore promoting products in their videos is often successful.

If you’re successful in identifying the right influencers for your brand, you can have your message spread to an immense and targeted audience in no time. 

## Utilize Hashtags

Throughout the duration of your video, it's important to make sure it’s optimized to make sure it’s visible to as many people as possible.

Once your video is live, come up with hashtags related to your brand and topic that viewers may be interested in. If you build the right hashtag strategy, you’ll be able to get your videos in front of the right people.

## Always Analyze the Results

As is the case with any online marketing campaign, it’s important to remember that your organic TikTok strategy should always be followed up with analysis and evaluation. You need to track the performance of your campaigns to be able to make improvements where needed.

Regularly checking on your progress will also give you potential insights and ideas that you can use to tailor future campaigns.

## Take Advantage of the TikTok Community 

TikTok is a vibrant global community, with a lot of content being produced every day. All that content makes it difficult to be heard, but that also provides you with an opportunity to stand out and be creative with your organic TikTok strategy.

By paying close attention to popular trends and understanding how to use TikTok to reach your desired audience, you will have a much better chance of succeeding with your campaigns.

## Final Thoughts 
Developing an effective organic TikTok strategy is about understanding the platform and taking advantage of potential opportunities. From understanding the algorithm and leveraging TikTok ads to partnering with influencers and utilizing hashtags, these strategies can help you get the desired results from your campaigns. 

Having a good understanding of the platform and its users, as well as an effective content strategy, are also essential components of an effective organic TikTok strategy. By taking these steps, your business will find it much easier to reach and engage its target audience.
