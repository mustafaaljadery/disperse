Social media has exponentially increased its ability to reach potential customers and engage in meaningful dialogue with customers. but social media is only as effective as its user’s ability to effectively utilize it. that’s why understanding the five pillars of social media marketing is integral to optimizing the success of any organization.

## Pillar 1: Content

Content is the cornerstone of any successful social media marketing plan. A post should have a purpose or central theme. Content should be accurately typed and grammatically correct. Content should include keywords, hashtags, and images, video or audio content to catch the reader's attention and keep them engaged. Interested readers have a higher likelihood of sharing content, so creating well-crafted and compelling content is of the utmost importance.

## Pillar 2: Connection

Establishing a direct connection with customers is key in any social media marketing strategy. Successful social media marketing should involve responding to the target audience’s questions, concerns and conversations about the organization or brand. By doing so, the organization builds up its credibility among its followers and establishes a solid base to rely on for future interactions.

## Pillar 3: Engagement

Engagement is the reason for social media marketing. Organizations must create content that drives user engagement, encourages conversations between the organization and its followers, and invites participation. Additionally, user generated content such as user reviews and ratings can be greatly beneficial for the organization. UGC allows organizations to gain valuable insight about its customers and products that can be used to inform future decisions.

## Pillar 4: Reach

Social media allows for the spread of information beyond traditional marketing tactics such as TV and radio. Reaching potential customers is the aim of social media marketing. It is essential to understand the social networks that your customers are utilizing, what type of content resonates with them, and how to strategically use influencers to amplify your reach.

## Pillar 5: Analytics

Measurement is a critical part of any successful social media marketing strategy. It is essential to measure the success of each campaign and the effectiveness of each post. Analytics allow marketers to track the ROI of their content and identify opportunities for growth.

Each pillar serves an important role in marketing success. By understanding the five pillars of social media marketing and utilizing them accordingly, organizations can build their brands and increase their customer relationships. Content, connection, engagement, reach and analytics are all pillars that need to be considered to take an organization’s social media presence to the next level.
