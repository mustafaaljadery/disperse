Webinars are one of the most powerful tools available to reach new audiences and engage existing ones. With the ability to reach thousands of people in a single live broadcast, webinars are an extremely effective way to extend your reach. However, most webinars are only broadcast once and then forgotten. To truly maximize their potential, webinars need to be repurposed in order to reach new people and continue to engage existing ones. 

With the right strategies, you can repurpose your webinars and create a greater overall impact. Here's how: 

## Create a Webinar Series 

One of the best ways to repurpose a webinar is to create a webinar series. By creating a series of webinars around a common theme, you can extend the value of each individual webinar and create a more comprehensive understanding of the topic. A series of webinars can also create a kind of “event effect” that brings people back, time and time again. This kind of consistency can help build a stronger relationship with your audience, generating greater engagement and interest in what you’re teaching. 

## Repurpose Your Content Into Video Formats 

Webinar recordings can be repurposed into short videos as an effective and engaging way to get the same message across. Many of the same strategies used in webinars can be used for videos, such as reusing slides and demonstrating certain techniques. Additionally, by sharing video content on platforms like YouTube and Vimeo, you can extend the reach of your content and engage with a broader audience. 

## Convert Webinars Into Blog Posts 

You can easily repurpose webinars into blog posts and other written content. This can be achieved by taking the recording and transcripting key segments of the webinar into blog posts. This approach is often used today to turn live interviews into written pieces. Taking this approach to webinars can be extremely effective if done right, as you can target specific keywords and points of discussion instead of having to worry about recapping the whole conversation. 

## Turn a Webinar Into a Live Webinar 

If you are looking to give your webinar content a new twist, you can convert it into a live version. By keeping the same subject, you can use a previously recorded webinar and turn it into a live conversation where participants can actively engage and interact with each other. This approach allows you to offer new insights and relevant questions in the discussion, in addition to giving people the chance to ask their own questions. 

## Create Webinar Highlights 

If you have a large webinar recording, you may want to showcase key points from it in short clips. By doing this, you can capture the attention of people who don’t have the time to watch the entire webinar, but are still interested in the content. Creating webinar highlights can also be an effective promotional tool, as you can showcase key points from the webinar in a more concise manner.

## Repurpose Your Webinar Slides 

Webinars are a great opportunity to assemble information into a cohesive story or teaching session. By repurposing these sessions into visuals, you have a chance to extend the reach of your content even further. You could create an infographic with a summary of the webinar, or use slides as visuals for other types of content, such as blog posts or even social media posts. 

By using some of the strategies above, you can easily repurpose your webinars and extend the reach of your content. Webinars are a powerful tool with virtually unlimited potential when used correctly, and are useful for any size business.  Consider some of the above strategies to ensure you are getting the most out of your webinars. 

Given the right strategies, repurposing your webinars can result in a greater overall impact. Boost your reach and engagement by using some of the above strategies. From creating a webinar series to repurposing your content into video formats, these tips will help you extend the reach of your webinars and the success of your business.
