* **Account Management:** Automation tools will also give you an overall view of each social media account. This allows you to see which posts are performing well, which hashtags are trending and which accounts you should focus more attention on.

* **Consistency:** Automating your accounts means you can maintain a consistent presence on social media. This will help with engagement and build a stronger relationship with your followers.

* **Time Saving:** Most of all, automation tools save you a large amount of time when compared with manually updating social media accounts. You can use this time more effectively, allowing you to concentrate on generating quality content instead of constantly posting about it.

* **Flexibility:** Automation tools should be able to accommodate any type of content, from simple text post to image galleries. This will make it easy to repurpose content across multiple platforms.

* **Cost:** Most automation tools are free initially, but will then require a premium subscription. Consider the value of the features and the cost of the subscription before taking the plunge.
