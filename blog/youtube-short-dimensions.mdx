Are you looking to understand how to optimize YouTube short dimensions to help achieve better SEO performance? This guide covers everything you need to know to do just that. 

## What are Short Dimensions?

Short dimensions refer to the dimensions of a video thumbnail, which are typically the same on most platforms. This includes YouTube, where the minimum width should be 640 pixels and the minimum height at 360 pixels, with an aspect ratio of 16:9.

## What are the Benefits of Optimizing Short Dimensions?

Optimizing the size of the short dimensions of your YouTube videos helps to ensure better visibility on the web for your content. By ensuring that your videos have the correct short dimensions, you’ll help to ensure that your videos show up prominently and attract more clicks. Other potential benefits of optimizing your video’s short dimensions include higher rankings in the search engine result pages (SERPs) and better engagement from viewers.

## How to Optimize Short Dimensions

To get started with optimizing the short dimensions of your YouTube videos, make sure that your videos are encoded correctly. The right encoding format will ensure that your videos appear at the right size and have the correct aspect ratio.

Once you’ve encoded your videos correctly, you’ll need to apply the correct dimensions to your videos. If your videos are not already in the correct size, you can resize them using an online or desktop video editor. 

You can also add subtitles and captions to your videos to make them more visible in SERPs and help optimize their short dimensions. Subtitles and captions provide additional content for search engines to index, making it easier for your videos to be seen.

Lastly, add a description to your videos. Make sure to include relevant keywords in the description so your videos can be indexed and ranked correctly by search engines.

## Conclusion

Optimizing the short dimensions of your YouTube videos is a great way to get better visibility and higher rankings on the web. By encoding your videos correctly, applying the correct dimensions, adding captions and subtitles, and including the right keywords in your descriptions, you’ll be able to get your videos seen and ranked more highly by search engines.  Optimizing the short dimensions of your videos leads to better visibility, more clicks, and more views.
