## TikTok Organic Explained

Organic content is content that you create about your brand that goes viral on the TikTok For You page. As opposed to paid advertising, where you pay the platform to serve your video. Organic content is served for free by the recommendation algorithm.

The key here is to make content that other people want to watch. In an ad, people don’t want to see the ad, but, TikTok must serve them to make money.

**Important:** TikTok organic is amazing for your business if you produce a lot of content.

## Organic vs Paid Ads

To note, both strategies, done well, are really good at acquiring new customers. You must figure out which one is right for your business.

If you produce a lot of long-form content in the form of podcasts, webinars, or YouTube videos, then organic may be a huge channel for you.

If you are not repurposing your content into short clips and posting them on all platforms with a tool like Disperse, you are missing out on a lot of engagement.

Moreover, if TikTok organic is done well, CPM is a lot less than paid ads. You are building an audience for free. That audience is also more trusting of your content as trust in ads keeps going down.

## Video Retention

The most important thing to the TikTok algorithm is video retention. Did users watch your video to the end? How many seconds of video did the users watch?

It’s very easy to tell, look at all the highly viewed videos on your TikTok For You page, you watched most of them to the end.

Also, that is how TikTok makes money. When you leave the app, they cannot serve you ads, so they lose money. They are incentivized to make you stay on the app as long as possible.

You want to make content that engages the user and incentivizes them to watch till the end.

## A lot of Content

The main formula for building a large organic content acquisition system is to have a lot of short-form content. The more content you have, the higher the chances that one of them is going to go viral.

The best way to do this is to already have another long-form content channel. For example, if you have a podcast, all of a sudden each episode can turn into 10 pieces of content.

This is ideal as you won't have to create content from scratch. Each piece of content will only take a few minutes of your time.

## Scaling the System

There are two ways to scale this system. Vertically and horizontally.

To scale vertically you have to post more content on more platforms. Post 4 times a day and repurpose those TikTok videos to Instagram Reels, Youtube Shorts, Facebook Reels, and Pinterest. Use a tool like Disperse, to automatically do this for you.

To scale horizontally, make more channels. Make more channels on different aspects of your business and start putting out a lot of content on those channels.

Those are the only two ways.

## Summary

Organic is a brand new acquisition channel that has evolved from a change in recommendation algorithms. It’s content that is recommended to you on your For You page. The best way to start a content strategy is to already have a long-form content channel for your business.

If done right, organic is much more effective than paid ads. CPA, CPC, and CPM are much less than that of paid ads, as you already have customer trust.
