With social media users flooding to Instagram each day, it has become one of the most popular platforms for online content. Adding Instagram to your social media plan can be beneficial to any business or individual but many website owners and bloggers are struggling with how to use the popular photo-sharing digital platform to their advantage. The best way to get the most mileage out of your content is to repurpose and maximize the potential of your content from the other digital outlets.

## Start with Relevant, Engaging Content

The most important part of creating high-quality content for any platform, particularly Instagram, is to create content that is useful or engaging. Finding ways to keep your content fresh, while still remaining relevant to your overall message, is key. The content you make for Instagram should be focused on the interest of your target audience in order to capture their attention. If you have quality content, people will be more likely to engage with it. 

## Adapt Your Content for Instagram

Once you've created your content, it needs to be adapted for the Instagram platform. The content you use for other digital outlets can likely be used on Instagram as well, although you'll need to make some changes to make the content work for the platform. 

### Images

Instagram is a visual platform, so it's important to feature visually appealing images to accompany your posts. Make sure you choose images that are clear and vibrant and are related to the content you are sharing. Choosing images that are related to the topic can help draw more eyes to your post. 

### Language

Since there is only room for a few words on an Instagram post, you need to make sure that the language you're using for your posts is concise. Keep your language short and to the point, while still accurately reflecting the purpose of the post. It takes practice to get the most out of your writing on Instagram, but it’s worth it to make sure that every post is informative and effective. 

### Hashtags

Hashtags are one of the most effective ways to reach a wider audience on Instagram. Make sure to use relevant hashtags that are related to the content that you are posting. It can be beneficial to use both relevant hashtags, as well as popular hashtags that have a larger reach. The more relevant hashtags you use, the better chance you have of being seen. 

## Stay Consistent

When it comes to Instagram, frequency is important. By staying consistent with your posting and engagement, you’ll be more likely to gain more followers and engagement on your posts. Posting regularly and staying engaged with the community that has grown around you can help you expand your reach and engagement.

## Conclusion

Using Instagram can be a powerful way to increase exposure for your business or your personal brand. Although the digital platform is centered around visual content, it's important to use the power of words to boost your reach and engagement. Repurposing your content for the Instagram platform can be a great way to maximize your exposure and reach a new audience. With the right strategy, you can create content that resonates, and get the most out of Instagram.
