## Why Should I Use Diseprse For My Business?

Our goal at Disperse is to create a workflow that helps users build the best possible content which in tail, is the best for users' social accounts. Not only does a large following bring in more customers through word-of-mouth referrals, but a large following also builds a brand.

Media and social content are important in the era of leverage. A single piece of content can reach millions of viewers or even billions. In a sense, you create the piece of content once, and it reaps benefits over time the more your nurture the content.

Furthermore, social channels shouldn't be thought of as customer acquisition channels (they can be), social channels are most effective as interaction points. Studies show that buyers of a certain product need at least 7 interaction points with the product before they are comfortable with buying. Social channels should be thought of as one interaction channel.
