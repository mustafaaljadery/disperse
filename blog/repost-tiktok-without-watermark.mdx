TikTok can be a great source of entertainment and a powerful tool for marketing and promotion. Millions of people use the app every day to create and upload videos, making it a hotbed for creativity and humour. With so much content being shared, it can be tempting to repost videos on other social media platforms or websites for greater reach. However, if not done properly, the upload could be instantly unoriginal as all TikTok videos have a unique watermark with the app's logo. 

To ensure your TikTok reposts stand out, you'll need to know how to repost a video without the watermark. In this guide, we’ll give you the steps to achieve watermark-free TikTok reposts.

## Why You Should Repost TikTok Content Without the Watermark

The watermark on a TikTok video serves two purposes:

1. It identifies the source of the video and lets viewers know it originated on TikTok.
2. It prevents others from replicating the post, as you need access to the original post to remove the watermark. 

Considering how easy it is to find and repost good content on TikTok, removing the watermark from a clip may seem innocent enough. After all, the original uploader receives acknowledgement and credit for their work.

The problem is that reposting someone's content without permission could be a breach of copyright, given that watermarks are a form of digital protection. As such, it’s important to be careful when reposting content and ensure you always obtain the necessary consent. 

## How to Repost a TikTok Video Without a Watermark

So, you know why you should refrain from reposting a TikTok video without permission, but how can you legally repost someone else’s content? 

The answer lies in the TikTok app itself, which offers several options to repost videos and allow the original creator to get credit for the work featured. Here’s what you need to do:

### Step 1: Copy the Link

To get started, open the TikTok video you wish to repost. Tap the “Share” button (an arrow pointing to the right), select the “Copy Link” option and the link will be copied to your device’s clipboard. 

### Step 2: Create a Reel

Now, go back to the home page of the app, and select the “Reels” button (an infinity sign located on the right). This will bring you into the Reel creation page, which is where you’ll paste the link you copied earlier and add it to your reel.

### Step 3: Save Your Reel

Once you’ve added the selected video clip to your reel, you’re ready to save it and share it with your followers. Tap the “Save” icon (a checkmark icon), add a caption if needed, and your reel will be posted to your profile. 

### Step 4: Share Your Reel

Your reel will automatically be posted to your TikTok profile, but if you wanted to share it with viewers outside the platform, you can do so by tapping the “Share” button and selecting the “Share Outside of TikTok” icon. This will give you access to a range of social media and messaging apps, which you can use to share your reel with friends. 

## Reposting TikTok Videos With or Without a Watermark

As we’ve seen, it’s important to be mindful when approaching TikTok reposts, and to make sure you have permission from the account holder before sharing their content. 

Removing the watermark should never be done without permission, as this can be a serious violation of copyright laws. In contrast, reposting a video with a watermark is perfectly fine and a great way to promote the original creator. 
 
Following these simple steps will not only ensure your reposts remain compliant with the law, but also help support the original creators and allow them to get the recognition and credit they deserve.
