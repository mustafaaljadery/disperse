When it comes to successful marketing campaigns, having a clear plan and understanding of social media marketing deliverables can be incredibly valuable. As a business owner, you must be certain which type of content will best represent your brand and the kinds of objectives you’re hoping to reach.

## Understanding Your Goals

Before you can identify what type of social media marketing deliverables are necessary for your campaign, it’s essential to know what you want to achieve. Assessing the goals of your social media marketing will provide you with the necessary information for developing a content plan with the right kind of deliverables.

Think about who your target audience is, how you’re expecting to reach them, and what your end-goal is for each social media post. For example, you may want to increase brand-awareness on Instagram, or increase website traffic through your Facebook page. The social media deliverables you create should be suited for your objectives.

## Measuring Your Success

It’s also important to consider metrics for tracking the success of your social media deliverables. Different goals will call for different metrics; however some common ways of measuring success across social media channels include engagement rate, website clicks from posts, conversions, share of voice, followers, and cost per conversion.

In addition to collecting data from the channels you’re present on, it can also be beneficial to compare your performance to competitors in terms of key performance indicators. Bringing together the achievements of other competitors can help with the development of strategies and deliverables on your own channels.

## Creating Your Content

Now that you understand the goals and metrics behind your social media strategy, it’s time to create the content itself. Depending on the platform you are leveraging, there are different kinds of social media deliverables to consider. Here are a few types of deliverables to include in your marketing plan:

### Infographics

Infographics can be a great way to represent information or data in an engaging and understandable way. They can be used to capture an audience’s attention and relay key information about a product or service.

### Videos and Animations

Videos and animations are becoming increasingly popular on social media, especially on platforms such as Instagram, YouTube, and Facebook. Placing your videos in front of the right audience can help with boosting engagement and brand-awareness.

### Live Stream Videos

Live videos allow your brand to reach a wider audience in real-time. Think of live streams as virtual interactions with prospective customers or clients. Creating an interesting atmosphere around your content can help with gaining and retaining followers.

### Social Media Contests 

Having a presence in contests can help your followers feel more engaged with your brand. Enticing contests can help with boosting engagements, referral sales, and website visits.

### Influencer / Brand Partnerships

Partnering with other brands or influencers can be an effective way of increasing your reach. Working with influencers can help you to build brand-awareness with potential customers and establish trust with them.

## What Works 

Social media deliverables can range from traditional advertising to interactive content, or even distributing helpful information. Knowing which type of content works the best on each platform will help you to achieve your end-goals. Every type of content should also be tailored to your target audience, as not all social media platforms have the same user demographic.

## Conclusion 

Social media marketing deliverables are the backbone of a successful social media strategy. Knowing which types of content best reach your budget and target audience is key. Always keep in mind your goals, metrics for success, and the kinds of deliverables which will help you reach your objectives. With the right strategy in place, your campaign can be incredibly successful.
