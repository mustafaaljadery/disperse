Social media marketing has changed significantly over the years, but one platform that has established itself as an essential for any modern brand is TikTok. With more than 500 million users logging in each month, chances are you're already active on the platform.

The problem many TikTok users face is how to track their analytics. Knowing which of your posts is performing well, and which strategies work, can be hard to decipher given the sheer number of followers and views. This is where understanding your TikTok analytics can help.

Having insight into your followers, audience reach, views and more will make it easier to track the success of your account and update your content accordingly. Here are some simple strategies that you should focus on to get the most out of your TikTok analytics.

## Assess Your Followers 

The details you can uncover about your followers can be invaluable when it comes to reading the data analytics of your account. With each piece of data, you can better understand your audience so you can refine and update your content.

Start by looking at the basics. How many followers do you have? How about engagement? Are most of your followers located in certain parts of the world? Do any of the users have influential accounts? Look at the content your followers are engaging with and what they aren't, so you can adjust your content with the goal of higher engagement.

## Analyze Your Content Performance 

By looking at the performance of you individual pieces of content, you can further customize the content that goes on your page. Look at how many views each post has, and the amount of likes and comments it has received. This should give you a good idea of what works and what doesn't so you can refine your content.

Pay attention to the activity on each of your posts. Are there more people liking or commenting? Are there trends in the comments that need to be addressed? Knowing all of this can also help you decide whether you should focus more on short-term trends or long-term goals with your content.

## Track the Reach of Your Content 

Take a close look at the reach that your posts are getting. Are your posts reaching or impacting people that don’t yet follow you? These are considered impressions, and they can tell you a lot more than your follower count.

If you’ve been seeing a lot of views on your posts, but they’re not translating into followers or engagement, it could be a sign that your content isn’t interesting enough. Generally, it’s better to have a little higher reach than just relying on your followers. 

## Monitor Hashtags and Trends 

TikTok is renowned for its viral trends and culture, highlighting the importance of keeping tabs on the latest hashtags and trends. Pay attention to the type of content users are creating with these hashtags and trends, and use this as fuel when creating your own content.

Focus on trends that are interesting and relevant to your followers, instead of just those that are popular. Creating content that resonates with your followers is the best way to build a lasting connection.

## Set and Monitor Goals

Having goals for your TikTok account will make it easier to track the success of your content. It also helps to create a strategy that's measurable. Make sure to keep track of your progress, and revise your plan when needed.

Think about what type of success you want to see: Do you want to double your followers? Get more likes on each post? Post more frequently? Whatever it is that you're aiming for, keep track of it and make sure to review your data regularly.

## Utilize Your TikTok Analytics Tools 

To get the most out of your analytics, make sure to use the platform-enabled tools, such as TikTok Insights, that help you read the data. These tools provide details like views, likes, comments, and shares for each video, as well as the reach of each of your videos. You can also identify the times of day when you’re getting more engagement on your posts. 

By using these insights, you can refine your content and your goals in order to maximize your return on effort.

## Final Thoughts 

TikTok analytics should be a consistent part of your social media management plan. With the knowledge gained from these insights, you can better refine your content and better cater to your audience, allowing you to build a long-term relationship. 

By assessing your followers, analyzing your content performance, tracking the reach of your content, monitoring hashtags and trends, setting and monitoring goals, and utilizing TikTok analytics tools, you’ll be well on your way to improving your presence on the platform.
