When the pandemic began, the streaming world skyrocketed with new interactive and fun platforms. Among them, two of the most popular short-form content creators are TikTok and YouTube Shorts.

For those unfamiliar with short-form content, it is defined as a "video of fifteen seconds or less." As such, these two creators have allowed their viewers to express themselves through their content in ways that never could have been imagined. 

## A Strong Start

TikTok began in 2018 and was created as a stand-alone app, “utilizing a sophisticated algorithm” designed to personalize content. It experienced immense success and soon became “one of the most fashionable apps among teens and young adults.” As of January 2020, it had been downloaded over 2 billion times and is currently considered a mainstream social media platform. 

YouTube Shorts launched in mid-2020 as a response to the growing popularity of TikTok. It was designed to be an additional tool that could be accessed through the YouTube platform. This was beneficial for the YouTube community as it allowed them to create and share short-form content quickly and easily. 

## Generation Z Drives Content

Generation Z (age 15-24) is credited for driving the popularity of short-form video content. Generally speaking, Generation Z is drawn to content that is creative, engaging, and entertaining. 

TikTok speaks to Generation Z by allowing them to take control of their creativity and share it in an innovative way. On TikTok, you can find videos that showcase skits, lip syncing, dancing, and other fun ways to express one’s self. The app also simplifies the process by which a video is created, with simple editing tools that allow users to make home videos or short videos with professional effects. 

YouTube Shorts caters to a slightly different audience within Generation Z. Their platform also utilizes fun and creative content but with a few extra features that make it stand out. YouTube Shorts provides users with three video editing tools: “Storyboard,” “Special Effects,” and “Music.” With Storyboard, users can create video compilations; Special Effects enhance visuals; and with Music, users can add music to their Shorts. All of these features make creating high-quality video content on YouTube Shorts easier than ever before. 

## Can YouTube Shorts Compete?

The introduction of YouTube Shorts has left some people wondering whether the platform can really compete with TikTok. YouTube provides more versatility and more potential for long-term success than TikTok, and its already established user base gives YouTube a significant advantage. 

YouTube Shorts also utilizes numerous features that are exclusive to the platform, which can help attract and retain viewers. Furthermore, it generally appeals more to millennials and older generations and, unlike TikTok, its content could potentially be monetized. 

It’s difficult to determine which of these short-form platforms will be more successful in the long run, as the two platforms are different in many ways. Ultimately, the winner will be determined by the quality of the content provided, the platform’s community, and its potential for success in the long term. 

## Conclusion

TikTok and YouTube Shorts have emerged as the top contenders in the world of short-form content. While TikTok has had a head start, YouTube has already established a strong user base, making it a credible competitor in this race. The success of either platform will be determined by the creativity and quality of the content, the potential for success in the long-term, and the strength of their communities. Only time will tell which platform will come out on top.
