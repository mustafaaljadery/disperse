            How Advertiser Led Companies Work
          </h3>
          <p className="mt-5 silka-regular text-gray-500">
            Companies that make money from advertising are
            double-sided marketplaces. A set of users give away their
            attention for entertainment or learning, and the other set
            buy that attention.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-5 silka-regular text-gray-500">
            You don&apos;t pay anything to use TikTok, Facebook,
            YouTube, or any social platform. You pay with your
            atttention.

          <p className="mt-5 silka-regular text-gray-500">
            Social platforms must have more advertisers, paying more
            money, year after year, to grow. In order to get more
            advertisers, they must have more attention. More people
            must watch videos from longer in order to get the
            attention.

            How is This Predicted
          </h3>
          <p className="mt-5 silka-regular text-gray-500">
            The recommendation algorithms has many inputs called
            feature ids. A feature id is an input given to the neural
            network to try and predict which video is best to
            recommend.{' '}

          <p className="mt-7 silka-regular text-gray-500">
            An example of the feature ids are:

          <ul className="mt-3 silka-rgular text-gray-500 list-disc">
            <li className="ml-8">Transcript of the video</li>

            <li className="ml-8 mt-1.5">Watch Time</li>

            All of these are processed as inputs to the probabilistic

            Something clickbaity, but not make it clickbait. It&apos;s
